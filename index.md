Final Fantasy XIV Online has been getting a lot of press lately as the place World of Warcraft players are finding refuge from the tedium of the latest expansion.

I’ve now watched enough content on YouTube to feel like I want to try.

I played WoW a lot before I had kids. On and off since the launch. The neurological grooves are pretty deep in my old grey matter.

First impressions of the game were…
“Huh. Sign up was easy.”
“Oh only a 40gb download to get started. That’s smaller than other games. But they don’t have that instant world streaming that WoW has.”
“This is mature software. It's responsive and always does what I expect.”
“Oh there are no Australian servers. I've gotta play on servers in Japan.”
“Oh there WILL be Australian servers when the next expansion launches.”
“Yup not playing a cat person. No thanks”
“Oh there’s a race that’s just kids…”
“Ok let’s go with one of these big green guys…”
“Wow, lots of customisation on the face and stuff…”
“Hehe there’s a boob size slider.”

I went with the class Marauder which seemed to suit my personality lorewise. Tank that uses a two handed Axe. I played a feral druid in WoW so I understand the streamlined queuing as Tank experience.

It plays exactly like WoW. I put the key binds in the same places and let the muscle memory kick in. The Global CoolDown feels longer than WoW. But the game felt solid and responsive as I played.

Noted some much more friendly community minded features like the Sprout / Mentor system that match makes newbs with OG pros. seems like a good initiative. We’ll see if it plays out in a useful way. The XP that you get for killing mobs is proportional to your contribution which is a nice way to stop competition for tagging. I remember being a Feral druid back in the day and pulling with Fairy Fire. Losing so many tags. Having to switch to caster to drop a moonfire just to tag properly to get XP and quest credit.

There’s all this stuff in my brain that is geared to being a MMO raider. But I just don’t have time in life for this stuff. Maybe I can just dip my toe into this game and scratch the itch a little. 

But I have already spent most of the day thinking about when I can get back on the game.

Like I said, those grooves are deep.
