OK. It’s great. It’s really interesting to see how big of an impact different design choices make for a very different community.

A lot of the design choices in the game set it up so that there's less of a competitive aspect to the game. As compared to World of Warcraft the lore of the world doesn't have two factions historically at odds. The Player's choice of race doesn’t determine their faction at the very start before they even know anything. There are these things called grand companies that you join around level 20 or 30 and they represent the pvp factions. The in game world lore explanation for this is that they are just wargame exercises.

Quests appear to have all of the quest items and mobs instanced for The Quester so I’ve never found myself competing for quest pickups or quest mobs. So far after 2 weeks playing I've never found myself annoyed at another player because of something they did or didn't let me do.

The technical limitations of being originally released on a Playstation 3 are obvious though the zones are quite small and there's a loading screen between each day so it doesn't have that same seamless world feel that World of Warcraft has. You get a loading screen, enter a zone and it will take 1 to 2 minutes to cross it then you hit another loading screen to go into another zone.

Older dungeons and content are not made irrelevant because veteran players are incentivised to go back and do them but they don't come with along all the associated power of being high level. Older content scales you down to it’s level. It's a nice way that they keep getting ROI on investments they made developing content 10 years ago.

I'm playing in little 30 minute Chunks. I login and if there's demand for a tank in the dungeon queuing system I join the queue wait 5 minutes then be in a dungeon run that otherwise I just follow the main Story quest which is by far the best way to get experience. You can change classes or what they call jobs at any time. You can go back to your original class/job at any time as well.  veterans recommend movies don't do this to style with the you just pick a job  and that's because the abilities are spread out between level 1 and level 80. So you spend a lot of time with just two or three or four buttons on your hot bar and combat feels a bit empty.

The World and Lore and Music just feel more upbeat than butch old World of Warcraft. Sure there are Bunny girls bounce around and the mounts are Chocobos (big yellow ostriches). The Mailboxes are little fat floating cats. Its’ Zany but in a really Final Fantasy way which is good if you know and love the series.

The music rings in my ears now even when I’m not playing. It’s a nice world to hang out in.
