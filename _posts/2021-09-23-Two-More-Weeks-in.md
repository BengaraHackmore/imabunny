So I started to Out level the main Story quest again.  As a consequence I put down the axe and picked up a katana. Yes, the Warrior of light is now training as a Samurai. It seems like an interesting class with a cool storyline. The rotation has you building up combo points from 3 different sets of combos to unleash devastating attacks while also maintaining a couple of self-buffs. I was hoping it would feel a bit like playing Soul Calibur it does a bit I suppose but what feels really missing is the launches and air combos and knockbacks so it doesn't really feel that much like Soul Calibur at all. Which is good, we don’t want to add a Mitsurugi clone to this line up in my head.

A couple of other interesting things have come up.

I have two daughters who absolutely love Bungara. So now she’s got some child appropriate outfits. The girls love picking the clothes for her to wear. I go to the Inn (where you can create, save, store and change outfits) let the girls pick a look. Then I pretend I’m the dad (interesting I said “pretend” yeah I saw it too)… Anyway if she’s not dressed appropriately I won’t let her out of the house. It’s a giggle-fest and a relatively safe way to explore some of the friction between dads and daughters around fashion, identity and this old fashioned notion of preserving innocence. Here’s hoping practicing it now can help us all have healthy conversations in the future.

Also I don’t want them to think Dad is a creep.

Then there’s another interesting and slightly disturbing thing.

As a gamer I’ve always played with my mouse inverted. So to make the camera look down I push the mouse up. Then to make it look up I pull back on the mouse. Oh friend once frowned at me with a stunned expression as I opened the game menu and flicking over to inverted. “So It’s like you’re flying a little plane around?” he asked hesitantly. I felt awkward as I explained yeah “Push forward to dive, pull back to climb.” Doesn’t that makes sense?

Or to get even further into my head (if you think that is wise) I imagine the mouse as the top of my characters head and then I push their head where I want it to look.

It’s always made sense to me. It’s always been like that I can’t fathom how other people do it the other way. But it did always make me feel a little different, part of the oddball minority and a hassle to host at game nights because I’m always the one who had to hit the menus to get the controls working right for me.

So weird tangent right?

Well here’s the thing, When I play as Bungara… The mouse isn’t inverted. It’s feels totally normal and natural and inverting just has me pointing the camera straight up or down and feeling odd and confused.

Is there something there? Why just that character? Is her identity becoming that strong within my psyche that she’s got a Y-Axis preference? She’s so confident! She’d be fun to have at game night.
