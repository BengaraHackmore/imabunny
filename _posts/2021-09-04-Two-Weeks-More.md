So I’ve spent the last week doing quests to improve my relationship with my Fairy companion. I also spent half my net worth on a dress that had no statistical benefit. I just thought it was pretty.

Turns out there’s a whole chunk of the community that considers fashion the end game for FFXIV.

I don’t know what is happening.

In more progression and less confusing news… I’ve unlocked raiding.

I’m raiding again. It’s only the level 50, 8 man raids. But it’s still scratching an itch that I’ve been ignoring for years.

I pushed it a bit hard last night though and ran the same raid twice. Started nodding off for the last boss. I blame the cut scenes though. The raid I’m running now is a key story moment and seriously the unskippable cutscenes, while a delight for my first run through, are starting to drag on. In that raid players spend more time in cutscenes than in fights. Great setup for first timers. Can see it being a drag pretty quickly. 

Because of that I had my first oh well I HAVE to do this moment with the game. I’ve been pretty much just doing whatever takes my fancy up to this point. This raid gives tokens that can be used to buy gear so that triggered the notion that it was somehow essential that I complete the raid despite nodding off at the keyboard.

Oh but I did hit 60 on the healer job I talked about last time. So I’ve bought the subsequent expansions.

The sensible thing to do now would be to push forward with the Main story till I hit 80.

Want to get there before November when the next expansion is released.

Aussie Servers BABY! Not that low ping helps when you are asleep at keyboard.
