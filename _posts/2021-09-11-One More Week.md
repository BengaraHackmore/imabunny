So something's happened to me. I am now... A Bunny a girl.

It happened late one night when I realised two things;
At level 50 you get the opportunity to change race
Since I’ve bought those expansions I have the Bunny Race available

I had seen the Glorious underdressed Bunnies bouncing around as I levelled up. But it wasn't until I loaded into the world with my glorious black and purple hairdo and long bunny ears that I realised this is who I am put on earth to be.

I realise now that I've been playing MMOs wrong since the start. It's not about grinding to get minor statistical upgrades! It's about suffering for fashion.

Yes, I am the Warrior of light the saviour of the known universe. Yes, I am a strong and powerful woman who has agency and solves her own problems. I am a kind soul who is admired for her courage, bravery and wisdom. I face down the perils of the world, those forces that would seek to corrupt and consume all that is good and pure AND there is absolutely no reason I should not look fabulous while I do it

Now, this might be where I lose you, dear reader. But bear with me I will explain.

I wear a metallic purple thong and crop top with thigh-high strappy boots. I have my hair, black with purple highlights in a high pony tied with a ring of daisies.

I look like a stripper.

I have 2 foot bunny ears black with purple tips.

I also carry a humongous axe, and due to my berzerker rage, I have never lost a fight.

I also wear glasses cause they’re cute.

People stop in the street when they see me.

People take the time to communicate and co-ordinate their tactics with me.

People are understanding when I make a mistake.


So maybe I’m a middle-age creeper playing a sexy stripper warrior archetype. But even when I played WoW and they allowed us the ability to transform our gear I had a policy of being as naked as possible. The key difference then was I was a male cow.

The difference between then and now is a different gender and slightly less fur.

I guess the takeaway is when your spirit is strong it doesn’t matter what you look like, you don’t need armour, so you might as well look amazing.
