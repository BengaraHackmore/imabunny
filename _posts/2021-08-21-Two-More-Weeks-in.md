So it happened. I’ve hit a patch of unhealthy playing.

I was delighted with the game as a casual running 30 minutes of Main Story Quest or doing a dungeon run each night. Getting so many commendations for tanking that I got the achievement and associated companion pet reward! Just from being a reliable tank. Brought a smile to my face.

But the XP leveling from the dungeons created a lag on my main story quest. Where I’ve outleveled the MSQ by about 20 levels. Which is fine, the story is fun and any important moments are all level synced anyway so there’s still an interesting challenge.

BUT! I hit level 60. Max level for the base version of the game I bought on steam. So now when I progress the MSQ I am just burning the XP rewards.

No problem I thought… And here’s where the problem behaviour started… I’ll just change to a healer job.

In FFXIV you can change your character's class by picking up different “jobs” and you can go back to the old jobs by equipping the right weapon for it. It’s an amazing player-friendly take on respecing.

I’d decided the healer I wanted to play was a job called Scholar. I’d read that it had good passive heals which is good for me as I tend to tunnel on tank healing and ignore healing the rest of the group.

Scholar is available after you level Arcanist to 30. No problem, I thought, I’ll run a few groups as a healing arcanist first… Wrong.

Archanist is a DPS class. I wanted to spec to a healer but had to push through 30 levels as a DPS class to get there.

Did it in a couple of long sessions over two nights. The wife is in bed with the girls, she falls asleep when we put them down for the night. So I’ve used that to stay up to 1 in the morning grinding out 30 levels of Arcanist so I could get to heal as a scholar.

Got it last night and ran a few runs and so far the passive healing from my pet has outpaced the damage of stuff we’re running at low levels. So I just DPS anyway!

It’s so fun.

So rewarding to get commendations from the group. I can’t wait to get back on and run some more. Then once the healer job is caught up to the MSQ level I can push the story forward and not waste the XP.

I feel my mind is slowly powering up those power gamer min maxing efficiency habits that leads to obsessive behaviour. And I love it.

I think the best option would be to stop right now. But I want to see the end of the story and it’s a legit relaxing/happy place for me when I’m not burning the candles at both ends to hit some self-imposed goal.

The second best option would be to buy the remaining expansions before I hit them in the main story quest. That would raise my max level to 80. But I don’t want to drop more money on the next expansions because that’ll be more money after this experience that I want to be able to stop when I choose, if I buy more expansions it’s more incentive to play for longer.

I am doing the worst option, grinding to catchup a job to my MSQ level because I want to have the option of not spending any more money on the game once this months subscription expires.

I think I should stop now.
